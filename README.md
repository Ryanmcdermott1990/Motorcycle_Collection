# C# - Motorcylce Collection 
This project was an introduction to WinForms and implementing logic for each of the elements within the form. The form lets the user to create, retrieve, update and delete records and save and load by reading and writing from a .dat file. 

Through completing this project I learned the following

- How to read and write from a file using System.IO library 
- Imlementing our own Binary and Linear search algorithms
- Utilising our own Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the records 
- How to maintain data integrity using correct application of data structures

Things I can improve on this app are;

- Styling 
Windows forms is old and outdated, it would be better to use WPF or UWP 

- Implementing Unit Tests
Testing the app through to make sure everything is working as expected

# How To Run
