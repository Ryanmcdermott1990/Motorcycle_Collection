# C# - AceDrones 
This project was for the final project of the C# unit at South Metro TAFE Certificate IV in programming.
The project was quite challenging as at that time I had less than 3 months worth of programming experience and knowledge.

Through completing this project I learned the following

- How to use WinForms to build a UI for visualising data 
- How to manage data locally through multi dimensional arrays 
- How to maintain integrity of the data between the different arrays 
- The best ways to structure a C# WinForms app by implementing logic in each of the elements on the form 
- Implementing a custom bubble sort function to sort records 

Things I can improve on this app are;

- Bringing the app in to 21st Century
Windows forms is old and outdated, it would be better to use WPF or UWP 

- Fixing Minor Bugs 
The app needs to be unit tested, it would be great to introduce these automated tests as what I found out is that changes in one part of the code will often break other parts of the application, this was a very challenging issue to overcome with this project. 

# How To Run 
You will need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed, (with a valid license)
Clone this repo and then open the project folder in Microsoft Visual Studio, click on run and the app should run in debugging mode.
